# hoplon-elem-lib

Tiny element library (20 LOC!) for Hoplon.

Features:

- Shows current state of args to the element
- Code syntax highlighting
- Cell-backed dynamic elements (and code blocks)
- Just a fnâ„¢

## Usage

Call `elem-lib.hoplon/elem` with meta info a reference to the el fn and some examples.

```clojure
(elem-lib.hoplon/elem
  "My element" ; title
  "Shows user random cat gifs on mousedown" ; description
  #'my.ns/many-cat-gifs ; the reference to the el fn (don't forget #' at the start!)
  [["No args"] ; list of examples, each example is [description & args]
   ["One cat" 1]
   ["Ten cats" 10]
   ["5 pouncing" 5 :pouncing true]])
```

## Examples

Checkout the github pages example:

https://thedavidmeister.github.io/hoplon-elem-lib/

It's based on the following example code:

```clojure
(elem-lib.hoplon/elem
 "Simple div"
 "This is just a div produced by hoplon"
 #'h/div
 [["No args"]
  ["Hello world!" "Hello world!"]
  ["A cell" (j/cell "A cell")]
  ["Attributes and content" :class "some-class" "Hi!"]
  ["A counter" (j/with-let [c (j/cell 0)]
                (h/with-interval 1000 (swap! c inc)))]])))
```

In case you don't want to look at the demo for some reason, the elements look like this:
